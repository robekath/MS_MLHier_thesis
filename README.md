# MS_MLHier_thesis
Work associated with my MS thesis. Machine learning methods for hierarchical data in Rstudio.

Source folder contains the R code functions specifically created and used for this thesis. They attempt to account for hierarchically structured data by using and, in some cases, manipulating existing R packages and functions.

For Random Forest: RF_hier_function.R

For Penalized Discriminant Analysis: PDA_hier_function.R

For Simulation: Simulation_hier_function.R
